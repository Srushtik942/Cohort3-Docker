# Harkirat Cohort3-Docker
 -  Made simple express application
 -  Tried to write simple dockerFile
 -  Docker Engine : is an open-source containerization technology that allows developers to package applications into container
 -  Docker Image : is a executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software [code, libraries and dependencies]
 -  Docker Container : encapsulates the application and its dependencies, running in an isolated environment.
 -  Docker Registry : is similar to github, but it lets you push images rather than sourcecode
       - Dockerâ€™s main registry - https://dockerhub.com/
 -  Docker common commands
      - docker ps
      - docker images [docker build -t image_name .]
      - docker run [docker run -p 3000:3000 image_name]
      - try visiting that particular port
      - docker build
      - docker push
      - docker exec -it <container_id> sh
      - docker kill <container_id>
-   Port Mapping
      - docker run -p 27018:27017 mongo
          - 27018 : image runs locally on port 27018
          - 27017 : image runs on container's port 27017
